ofcourse i don't mind cuddling and hiding you too. 

You can interact with me anytime, although i might put some DNI's sometimes.

 - i love interacting with chongyun / xingqiu skins a lot, so don't be suprised why i crowned you!!
 - i also love interacting with friends that i am very close with, shoutout to them https://media.tenor.com/jZ99-ZXO7XEAAAAM/chongyun-genshin.gif
 - silly people can interact with me too! I don't mind cold ones and kinda hard to talk with, i am quite happy to interact with you! 
	

I’m interested in drawing and is sometimes making quotes stories and journals in my free time. 
I don't exactly know what else i should put here hehe.  


I'm currently learning perspectives and other general languages like russian and chinese, please don't talk a lot with this because I'm just a beginner!

-   		  	      Please DNI! 🙏
-   		  	  
Please do not interact if you are a r@'c1st, p3d0¶hi/e, z0/ph1/e, pick me's, people who spread fake information and a gossiper.
I also do not like toilet jokes like p/3e and someone taking a dump! 
Please do not also make jokes about relatives or any d3@d / unalive that i am known with. 
Also do NOT interact if you make r@¶e jokes and unnecessary words or sentences that make me uncomfy. 

Although, as i said you can see me on ponytown as chongyun, xingqiu, venti and etc! I hope we can meet and interact soon!
